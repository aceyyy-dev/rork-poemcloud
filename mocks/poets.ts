His unique approach involved writing through multiple "heteronyms"—distinct personas with their own biographies, styles, and philosophies. His main heteronyms—Alberto Caeiro, Ricardo Reis, and Álvaro de Campos—each produced substantial bodies of work. Born in Lisbon, Pessoa was educated in South Africa and returned to Portugal at 17, spending his life there working as a commercial translator. He published little during his lifetime; after his death, over 25,000 manuscript pages were discovered. Pessoa\'s exploration of identity and consciousness prefigured postmodern literature.',
